FAQ:
Q: My level won't publish
You probably have an improperly named file -> https://discord.com/channels/1048213818775437394/1140219304952987722/1203764537308745728
Q: How do I put a level on my headset?
Read <#1179193425162158090>
Q: Can I import a 3D model into GRAB?
You cant import a model. The closest you can do is load a model as a point cloud and build over it manually in game. (insert > media > point cloud)
Q: CX File Explorer isn't working
CX File Explorer, Mobile VR Station, and similar apps don't work anymore. You need a PC.
Q: Can I download a level as a 3D model?
Yes. There is a bookmarklet on the GRAB Tools homepage, and an export as gltf feature in the JSON Editor. (file > export > .gltf)
Q: How do I make modded ambience?
Use the ambience sliders in the JSON Editor (edit > ambience > sliders) -> https://discord.com/channels/1048213818775437394/1140213329089003570/1325670902037352480

Q: How can I create a copy of a level?
Locate it by editing it in game and looking for the most recently edited file with SideQuest. Download that file, increment the name by 1 (E.g. 12345678.level becomes 1234567**9**.level), then reupload it to your headset.
Q: What does logging to GRAB Tools do?
When you are logged in, you will be able to see a personalised stats section in the stats page, you and your maps will be highlighted. You also need to be logged in to download levels.

Yes.

Q: How do I get modded block colors?
Saving them in game was removed, but you can still spawn them in with the JSON Editor. I recommend using the modded colors template (file > new > template) to find the one you like.
